    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In any machine learning task, cleaning or preprocessing the data is as important as model building if not more. And when it comes to unstructured data like text, this process is even more important. \n",
    "\n",
    "Objective of this kernel is to understand the various text preprocessing steps with code examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the common text preprocessing / cleaning steps are:\n",
    "* Lower casing\n",
    "* Removal of Punctuations\n",
    "* Removal of Stopwords\n",
    "* Removal of Frequent words\n",
    "* Removal of Rare words\n",
    "* Stemming\n",
    "* Lemmatization\n",
    "* Removal of emojis\n",
    "* Removal of emoticons\n",
    "* Conversion of emoticons to words\n",
    "* Conversion of emojis to words\n",
    "* Removal of URLs \n",
    "* Removal of HTML tags\n",
    "* Chat words conversion\n",
    "* Spelling correction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So these are the different types of text preprocessing steps which we can do on text data. But we need not do all of these all the times. We need to carefully choose the preprocessing steps based on our use case since that also play an important role. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in sentiment analysis use case, we need not remove the emojis or emoticons as it will convey some important information about the sentiment. Similarly we need to decide based on our use cases. "

    "Lower casing is a common text preprocessing technique. The idea is to convert the input text into same casing format so that 'text', 'Text' and 'TEXT' are treated the same way. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is more helpful for text featurization techniques like frequency, tfidf as it helps to combine the same words together thereby reducing the duplication and get correct counts / tfidf values.\n",

    "This may not be helpful when we do tasks like Part of Speech tagging (where proper casing gives some information about Nouns and so on) and Sentiment Analysis (where upper casing refers to anger and so on)\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, lower casing is done my most of the modern day vecotirzers and tokenizers like [sklearn TfidfVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html) and [Keras Tokenizer](https://keras.io/preprocessing/text/).
